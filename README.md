## Scala Machine Learning Toolkit
This is a general purpose ML toolkit for Scala. I love Scala and I don't get to play with it a lot
anymore. To solve that problem, I have decided to build a toolkit for ML in Scala.

I know there are a few of them out there but I really do not like their interface. I think python's
[scikit-learn]() is an amazing package with a nice API and so I will build this library along those
lines too.

Contributions are certainly welcome! Just send a pull request.

Generally speaking, I'm doing this to better understand the algorithms. Maybe at some point other
researchers will use this library :smile:


## Documentation
I will do my best to write very detailed documentation as I implement this toolkit and also create a
repository for examples. However, as this library is very much alpha, these examples will come a bit
later when I have settled on a nice API.
